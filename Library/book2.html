            <h4>Demon Copperhead</h4>
            <p>"Damon Fields tells the story of his life from birth to adulthood. Damon was born in Lee County, which is located in the Appalachian region of Virginia. His nickname, Demon Copperhead, is a play on “Damon.” Copperhead comes from his father’s nickname, and it’s also a reference to Demon’s red hair.

                Demon and his mom live in a trailer owned by the Peggots, who live next door. Matthew Peggot, whom everyone calls Maggot, is around Demon’s age and is Demon’s best friend,. Demon is often in and out of the Peggot house, and the Peggots serve as a kind of surrogate family for Demon.When Demon is a boy, Demon’s mother becomes involved with a man named Stoner. Stoner is vituperative, strict, and abusive to both Mom and Demon. He tells Demon he can’t spend time with Maggot because he suspects Maggot is gay. Whenever Stoner is around, Mom seems to shrink into the background. One day Mom overdoses on painkillers, and Demon is assigned a caseworker from the Department of Social Services (DSS), Miss Barks. Unable to live with Mom while she’s in recovery, Miss Barks finds Demon a temporary foster care placement at a farm belonging to a man named Mr. Crickson. At Crickson’s farm, Demon lives with Mr. Crickson’s other foster children, Tommy and Fast Forward. Tommy is kind and caring, while Fast Forward is the larger-than-life quarterback of the high school football team. Crickson takes the boys out of school to do manual labor on the farm.

                On Demon’s eleventh birthday, Miss Barks calls him and tells him that his mom has died of an overdose. Demon doesn’t know whether her death was a suicide or an accident. He also doesn’t know where he’s going to live now that Mom has died. That Christmas, he accompanies the Peggots to nearby Knoxville. In Knoxville, Demon sees Aunt June who has adopted her niece, Emmy, after Emmy’s dad died. Emmy and Demon spend many nights staying up late and commiserating.</p>
