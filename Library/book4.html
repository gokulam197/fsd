            <h4>In Search of Lost Time
            </h4>
            <p>In Search of Lost Time by Stéphane Heuet is a graphic novel adaptation of Marcel Proust’s classic novel of the same title. Heuet follows the original text closely, opting to use visuals to convey much of the inner monologue and symbolism in the story.

                The story begins with the narrator commenting on his habit of going to bed early. He ponders how sleep alters perception. He recalls his room at his family’s home in Combray, and in particular one evening when a man named Charles Swann visited. As a result of this visit, his mother does not kiss him good night, but does read to him. This is the only memory he has of that house. One day he eats a madeleine cake dipped in tea, and the taste suddenly unlocks a memory of having a madeleine at Combray as a child. This leads to further revelations—his meeting a lady dressed in pink, his love of the theater, his Jewish friend Bloch. He learns that Swann entered into an unhappy marriage and wishes to see his daughter Gilberte move up in society. The narrator recounts his walks through the country following two distinct routes; on one walk he sees Gilberte talking to a lady in white. On another walk he witnesses a lesbian encounter. He recalls how Swann was invited into a social circle ruled by Madame Verdurin by Odette de Crecy. Swann and Odette form a close relationship, but Swann later curdles into jealousy and Odette rejects him. Swann slowly gets over this, and later marvels he ever cared for her. The narrator wishes to travel, but is ill, so substitutes a walk in Paris. He meets Gilberte and reveals that Swann did eventually marry Odette. The narrator ponders the transient nature of life.
                
                At a dinner with his parents, the narrator shows an example of his writing to a diplomat named Norpois, who indicates it is not very good. The narrator continues to meet Gilberte in Paris; they play and wrestle and the narrator experiences an orgasm. He begins to visit Gilberte at the Swann’s house regularly. When they get into a terrible fight the narrator leaves and waits for her to write, but she does not and slowly he forgets her. While vacationing with his grandmother, the narrator becomes obsessed with a group of young country girls. He meets a painter who knows them, and the narrator meets the beautiful Albertine Simonet and begins to spend time with her and her friends. She rejects his advances but they remain friends.
                
                
                
                The narrator becomes obsessed with the wealthy and glamorous Guermantes family. He returns home when he hears his grandmother is ill, and struggles with being unable to begin writing. His grandmother suffers a stroke just as he is making some inroads with the Guermantes, and soon dies. He is visited by Albertine and they kiss. He is invited to a party at the Guermantes, and meets the cream of society there, and engages in gossip which gets him into trouble. He is invited to a society party but is uncertain whether he is truly welcome, but when he arrives he is greeted warmly.</p>
